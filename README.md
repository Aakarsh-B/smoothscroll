# smoothscroll
<p>A simple front end feature that can be used in multiple situations. I'm still learning front end development and I wanted to try out all the cool features one by one. I fount the smooth scroll feature to be fascinating. The plugin I have used here is apparently outdated and there are better ways to go around the same function. However, I wanted to create something that looked good with what I had. So I ended up with this.</p>

<p>This feature has many applications as it can be used in any homescreen, navigating to various sections of the same screen. This is a pretty basic front end feature and can be done without the use of this plugin now. Anyways, I learnt something new today yay :P</p>

### DISCLAIMER
<p>The User Interface has been mainly focused here rather than the script.</p>
<p>A detailed explanation of how to use the script is available <a href="https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll">here</a></p>

### credit where credit is due
The script used was created by <a href="https://github.com/cferdinandi">Chris Ferdinandi</a>.
Quoting Chris, a CSS-only method for smooth scrolling has emerged, and now has fantastic browser support. It can do things this plugin can't (like scrolling to anchor links from another page), and addresses bugs and limitations in the plugin.
