#### credit when credit is due
The script used was created by <a href="https://github.com/cferdinandi">Chris Ferdinandi</a>.
Quoting Chris, a CSS-only method for smooth scrolling has emerged, and now has fantastic browser support. It can do things this plugin can't (like scrolling to anchor links from another page), and addresses bugs and limitations in the plugin.
